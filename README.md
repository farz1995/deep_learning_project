# Deep Facial Affect Recognition

this repository was built for deep learning projects that were implemented for facial affect recognition.
all project has been written with tensorflow (keras) framework in python.
more project and their details will be added soon ...

here is some sample from affect detection in both categorical and dimensional, also, 12 AUs in faces were detected:
