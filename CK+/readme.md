predict facial emotion in CK+ dataset.
i used a cnn layers of a pre train FER network to convert frames in to a vector, after that i only use those features to predict emotion in bunch of video frames.
for the architecture i used attention layer for sequence of feature vectors (converted images).
the results are comparable to the state of the art methods.
